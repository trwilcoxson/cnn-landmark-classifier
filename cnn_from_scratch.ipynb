    "The project folder has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the main directory you have this notebook, `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb`, that contains the instruction and some questions you will have to answer. Follow this notebook and complete the required sections in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the `src/` directory you have several source files. As instructed in this notebook, you will open and complete those files, then come back to this notebook to execute some tests that will verify what you have done. While these tests don't guarantee that your work is bug-free, they will help you finding the most obvious problems so you will be able to proceed to the next step with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes you will need to restart the notebook. If you do so, remember to execute also the cells containing the code you have already completed starting from the top, before you move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will create a CNN that classifies landmarks.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although 50% may seem low at first glance, it seems more reasonable after realizing how difficult of a problem this is. Many times, an image that is taken at a landmark captures a fairly mundane image of an animal or plant, like in the following picture.\n",

    "\n",
    "An accuracy of 50% is significantly better than random guessing, which would provide an accuracy of just 2% (100% / 50 classes). In Step 2 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to greatly improve accuracy by using transfer learning to create a CNN.\n",

For training, a **random crop** is used to introduce spatial variability — the model sees slightly different regions of the image each epoch, which acts as a form of data augmentation. For validation and test sets, a **center crop** is used for consistent, reproducible evaluation. The 224×224 input size is standard for CNN architectures and provides enough spatial resolution for landmark recognition.\n\n**Data Augmentation:** Yes, the training set is augmented with:\n- **Random horizontal flips** — landmarks look the same mirrored (e.g., a building flipped horizontally is still recognizable)\n- **Random rotation (±15°)** — accounts for photos taken at slight angles\n- **Color jitter** (brightness, contrast, saturation ±20%) — accounts for varying lighting conditions (sunny, cloudy, indoor, etc.)\n\nThese augmentations increase the effective training set size and help the model generalize to real-world photos taken under diverse conditions.\n\n**Normalization:** After converting to tensors, all channels are normalized using the dataset's per-channel mean and standard deviation. This centers the data around zero and scales it to unit variance, which helps gradient-based optimization converge faster and more reliably."

This is especially important for a 5-block architecture where gradient flow can degrade.\n\n3. **MaxPool2d(2,2) in blocks 1–4:** Each max-pooling layer halves the spatial dimensions (224→112→56→28→14), giving the final conv layer a 14×14 feature map to work with. This progressive downsampling builds translation invariance.\n\n4. **AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1,1):** Instead of flattening the final feature map directly (which would create a large, fragile fully-connected layer), global average pooling reduces each 512-channel feature map to a single value. This dramatically reduces parameters and makes the model more robust to input size variations.\n\n5. **Classifier with Dropout:** Two linear layers (512→256→50) with ReLU activation and dropout (p=0.4) between them. Dropout prevents co-adaptation of neurons and combats overfitting, which is critical given the relatively small training set (~5,000 images for 50 classes).\n\n6. **No softmax in forward():** The raw logits are output, as `CrossEntropyLoss` in PyTorch internally applies `LogSoftmax` for numerical stability."
