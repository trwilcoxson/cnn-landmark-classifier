Landmarks share many visual primitives with ImageNet categories (buildings, natural scenery, architectural details).\n\n2. **Frozen backbone, trainable FC layer:** All convolutional layers are frozen (`requires_grad = False`), preserving the pretrained features. Only the final fully-connected layer is replaced with `nn.Linear(512, 50)` and trained from scratch. This approach:\n   - Prevents catastrophic forgetting of pretrained features\n   - Drastically reduces training time (only ~25K trainable parameters vs ~2.5M in the full network)\n   - Reduces overfitting risk on our small dataset (~5K training images)\n\n3. **Why ResNet18 specifically:**\n   - **Fast:** Smallest ResNet variant, trains quickly even on CPU/MPS\n   - **Reliable:** Skip connections ensure stable gradient flow\n   - **Simple interface:** Uses a single `.fc` attribute for the classifier, making it straightforward to replace\n   - **Sufficient capacity:** 512-dimensional feature vectors are rich enough to discriminate 50 landmark classes\n\n4. **Training strategy:** Adam optimizer (lr=0.001) with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler provides fast convergence. With frozen backbone, training only the FC layer converges in ~10-15 epochs, achieving 60-80% test accuracy — significantly higher than the from-scratch CNN."

    "Now play with the hyperparameters and see which performance you can get on the validation set. You should get at least 60% for a passing grade, but a good model choice and a good training strategy could get you up to 80% or so. Let's see how close you can get!"
